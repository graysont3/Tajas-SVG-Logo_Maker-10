## Tajas-SVG-Logo_Maker-10

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to help freelance developers generate simple logos for their projects. I builit this project because freelance developers already have enought on their plates as is so having an application that relieves some of the stress is very useful. It solves the problem of having to pay tons of money for graphic designers to do it. 


## Installation

Clone the repository in VS code, open a new terminal, and type 'npm i' to install all necessay dependencies.

## Usage

To prompt the application type 'enter node index.js' in the terminal. This will prompt a series of questions that will then generate the SVG logo.
